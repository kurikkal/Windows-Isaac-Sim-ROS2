Right Click, select More then "Run as Administrator"
Copy the following command line:
```
@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
```
Paste it into the command window.
Approve any prompts
Once it has completed, close the command prompt to complete the install.
Install Git:

Reopen the Visual Studio Command Window as described above.
Please install Git using the command here, even if you have it installed as an application:
```
choco upgrade git -y
```
Close and Reopen the Visual Studio Command Window as described above.

Ensure Git is now available in the Visual Studio command window:
```
